                        The Chain's Origin Story

                    <p className="text-base opacity-80">
                        In the midst of the bull run of 2022, Monica discovered
                        a remarkable truth about Miami â€“ a city with people
                        passionate about web3, yet no place for them to connect.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base opacity-80">
                        With a simple tweet to gauge the presence of the local
                        web3 community, Monica's expectations were surpassed
                        revealing an undeniable need for connection and IRL
                        community for web3 builders in Miami.

                        In June 2022, The Chain was born, a community for local
                        builders and forward-thinkers in the web3 space to
                        connect through monthly dinners and keep the local web3
                        community up-to-date by launching a texting community
                        that shares upcoming events, and a celebration of
                        community wins.

                    <p className="text-base opacity-80">
                        In the past year, we've hosted 12 dinners & experiences,
                        uniting 500+ people. Now, as we enter our growth stage,
                        we're more intentional than ever in curating our
                        community.

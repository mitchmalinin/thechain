          The Chain's Origin Story:

        <Text opacity="0.8" fontSize={{ sm: '14px', lg: '16px' }}>
          In the midst of the bull run of 2022, Monica discovered a remarkable
          truth about Miami â€“ a city with people passionate about web3, yet no
          place for them to connect.

        <Text opacity="0.8" fontSize={{ sm: '14px', lg: '16px' }}>
          With a simple tweet to gauge the presence of the local web3 community,
          Monica's expectations were surpassed revealing an undeniable need for
          connection and IRL community for web3 builders in Miami.

        <Text opacity="0.8" fontSize={{ sm: '14px', lg: '16px' }}>
          In June 2022, The Chain was born, a community for local builders and
          forward-thinkers in the web3 space to connect through monthly dinners
          and keep the local web3 community up-to-date by launching a texting
          community that shares upcoming events, and a celebration of community
          wins.

        <Text opacity="0.8" fontSize={{ sm: '14px', lg: '16px' }}>
          In the past year, we've hosted 12 dinners & experiences, uniting 500+
          people. Now, as we enter our growth stage, we're more intentional than
          ever in curating our community.
